# JATE - web application

## Description
The site of this is the creation of several code to implement and create a text application where you can add text into the application which will install. I created this as an application in which a user can add and modify text. The problem that I had with this was the fact that the application was the scripts as I would try to run npm server.js, and the folder structure as it was quite confusing to go through. It uses mongoose, concurrently, express, and nodemon to run this application.
